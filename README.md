# Binary Tree Manipulation Project in C

This project provides a comprehensive set of functionalities for manipulating binary trees in the C programming language. Binary trees are fundamental data structures used to organize and structure data hierarchically.

## Overview

The Binary Tree Manipulation Project aims to facilitate various operations on binary trees, offering a wide range of functionalities for creating, modifying, and analyzing binary tree structures. Whether you need to build, traverse, or analyze binary trees, this project has got you covered.

## Features

- **Binary Tree Creation:** Easily create a binary tree and visualize its structure.
- **Node Insertion:** Insert nodes as left or right children of existing nodes.
- **Tree Deletion:** Safely delete an entire binary tree when it's no longer needed.
- **Node Validation:** Check if a node is a leaf or the root of the tree.
- **Tree Traversal:** Perform pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversals and display node values.
- **Tree Metrics:** Measure the height, depth, and size of a binary tree.
- **Node Counting:** Count the number of leaf nodes and nodes with at least one child.
- **Balance Factor:** Calculate the balance factor to determine the tree's balance.
- **Tree Completeness:** Verify if a binary tree is complete.
